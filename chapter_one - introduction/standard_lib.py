The standard library is the jewel in Pythonâ€™s crown, supplying reusable modules that help you with
everything from, for example, working with data, through manipulating ZIP archives, to sending emails,
to working with HTML.

The standard library even includes a web server, as well as the popular SQLite database technology.

As the standard library is so rich, the thinking is all you need to be immediately productive with
the language is to have Python installed.
